Practice project utilizing React for frontend view
 - vite as build tool
 - CSS modules
 - Material UI
 - React Router
 - Redux for state management
 - React hook form for forms

Also Java as backend
- tomcat server
- servlets
- jdbc, jdbi for database access
- postgres as relational database

TODO:
- gradle scripts for:
  - copy db/create_schema.sql and drop_schema.sql to api/test/resources
  - dropSchema and createSchema scripts
  - update script
- creating a servlet front
  - with openapi specs (see how to generate spring server and typescript client)
  - after that - Spring (both DI, web, and testing)
  
After that focus more on frontend (react + ts)
